MongoDB Change Tracker WebJob
This project is a MongoDB Change Tracker WebJob built with C#. It leverages MongoDB Change Streams to monitor and react to real-time changes in your database collections. The WebJob can be integrated into Azure or run as a standalone application, making it a powerful tool for event-driven applications, auditing, or data synchronization tasks.

Features
Monitors MongoDB collections using Change Streams
Reacts to insert, update, replace, and delete operations in real-time
Easily deployable as an Azure WebJob or standalone app
Written in C# for seamless integration with .NET projects
Prerequisites
.NET SDK
MongoDB instance
Access to an Azure subscription (if deploying as an Azure WebJob)
Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/Girishtl/MongoDBChangetrackerWebjob.git
cd MongoDBChangetrackerWebjob
2. Configure MongoDB Connection
Update the connection string and database/collection details in your configuration file (e.g., appsettings.json or environment variables):

JSON
{
  "MongoDbSettings": {
    "ConnectionString": "<Your MongoDB Connection String>",
    "Database": "<Your Database Name>",
    "Collection": "<Your Collection Name>"
  }
}
3. Build and Run Locally
bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run
4. Deploy as Azure WebJob (Optional)
For Azure deployment, package your app and follow the official Azure WebJob deployment guide.

Usage
Once running, the WebJob listens for changes in the specified MongoDB collection and handles them according to your implementation (logging, triggering downstream processes, etc.).

Customization
Modify the change stream pipeline to filter for specific operations or document changes
Extend the handler logic to send notifications, update other systems, etc.
